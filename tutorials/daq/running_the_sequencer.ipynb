    "----\n",
    "In this notebook, we will show how to run the `Sequencer` class, which has been designed for automated running of a sequencer with changing DC values. The class requires a YAML file to define the various settings, for which we will provide an example. We will show how to run the sequencer in a notebook, as well as via the `splendaq` command line interface (CLI)."
