    "# Running the DC Sequencer\n",
    "----\n",
    "In this notebook, we will show how to run the `Sequencer` class, which has been designed for automated running of a sequencer with changing DC values. The class requires a YAML file to define the various settings, for which we will provide an example. We will show how to run the sequencer in a notebook, as well as via the `splendaq` command line interface (CLI).\n",

We then have the various inputs and outputs of the Moku:Pro, of which there are four of each. We define which inputs to log, and which outputs to apply DC voltages with (as well as defining the beginning and end values, and number of total steps).\n",

    "For the IP address, ensure it is passed as a string by keeping the `\"\"` around it. If connecting via USB-C, this will be an IPv6 address, which should be enclosed with square brackets, e.g. `[your_moku_ipv6_address]`.\n",
